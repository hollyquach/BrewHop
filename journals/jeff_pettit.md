Today I worked on:

* Getting our API documentation revised to reflect the use of the Yelp API
* Working on getting our Docker compose file constructed

After presenting to James early in the week we came to the realization that it makes more sense to just use Yelp's API than to plug multiple external databases into each other. After this pivot we revisited our documentation to ensure that the API planning was all up to date.

We started to build our Docker compose file to get the basis of our app up and running. We struggled for a while getting a syntax error fixed but eventually got there.

Today I worked on:

* Group planning of tasks, questions, and feature-construction

Our group focused on building out our project board to project manage the remainder of the project.
